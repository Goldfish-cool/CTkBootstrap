Not Every theme from ttkbootstrap is in here.

## Includes

** - Solar**

** - Darkly**

** - Cyborg**

** - Vapor**

** - Monodim**

** - Normal CTk**

** - Aurium**

## About Light Mode

Light mode is not everyone's preference, and there are several reasons for this. One major reason is that light mode can cause eye strain, especially in low-light environments. 
Additionally, some users find it harder to focus on the content when the background is bright, leading to decreased productivity. Furthermore, light mode can also make it difficult to distinguish between different UI elements, making the overall user experience less intuitive.

## Heavily Beta

This project is **HEAVILY IN BETA**, indicating that it is still in the early stages of development. 
As a result, it is expected that bugs and issues will arise. 
I am committed to addressing these problems as promptly as possible to ensure the project's stability and quality. 
Your patience and feedback are greatly appreciated during this beta phase.
